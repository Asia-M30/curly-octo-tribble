    <div class="feature box"><p>Hello! I am Asia, and sometimes people call me "A".
        <br><b>Welcome to my first blog.</b></br>
        This is my journey of becoming a front end web developer, starting a blog and all in the process of self exploration.
        <br> Hint! If you're wondering why my blog is named "The Healing Coder", Lol.</br>
        Healing to me, means trying new things, food, taking yourself on dates, a nice bath,buying yourself something nice and can't forget <mark>Therapy</mark><b> (HEAVY ON THERAPY TOO)!</b>
        Coder is for what I inspire to be, Software engineer to be fancy. But, back to about me. I love to read, travel, SING, enjoy nature, laugh and re-watch my favorite shows. I love to color and last year I picked up on drawing cartoon potraits. I love dogs and my favorite sitcom is Martin. I'm really all about healing, so I hhope you stay with me on my journey of starting a blog, becoming a front end web developer and all in the process of self exploration.
        Maybe we can heal together?
